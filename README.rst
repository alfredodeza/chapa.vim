Chapa
=====
Allows you to move to previous/next class, function or method 

or visually select the next/previous class, function or method. 

Installation couldn't be easier: drop the plugin file in your vim plugin 
directory.

I would highly recommend you use something like Pathogen though, it 
makes dealing with VIM plugins way easier.

1. Intro                                 
==============================================================================

After trying other plugins that were supposed to achieve this objective (and 
fail) I decided to write it on my own. 

The initial approach is to be able to simply have a visual selection of a 
Python Class or Function.

No need to have VIM compiled with Python support since this plugin uses 
pure VIM syntax.

2. Usage                                
==============================================================================

Straightforward (for now). Chapa has 8 public calls that you can map to 
anything you want. 

You can map those callables to anything you want, but below is how the 
author maps them (better mnemonics)::

  " Function Movement
  nnoremap fpf <Esc>:ChapaNextFunction<CR>
  nnoremap Fpf <Esc>:ChapaPreviousFunction<CR>

  " Class Movement
  nnoremap fpc <Esc>:ChapaNextClass<CR>
  nnoremap Fpc <Esc>:ChapaPreviousClass<CR>

  " Method Movement
  nnoremap fpm <Esc>:ChapaNextMethod<CR>
  nnoremap Fpm <Esc>:ChapaPreviousMethod<CR>

  " Class Visual Select
  nnoremap vapf <Esc>:ChapaVisualNextFunction<CR>
  nnoremap vapF <Esc>:ChapaVisualPreviousFunction<CR>

  " Method Visual Select
  nnoremap vapm <Esc>:ChapaVisualNextMethod<CR>
  nnoremap vapM <Esc>:ChapaVisualPreviousMethod<CR>


If the requested search (function, class or method) is not found, the call simply 
returns and nothing should happen. However, there is an error message that should 
display by default, explaining what it was supposed to search and in what 
direction.

You can disable this by adding a chapa-specific variable in your vimrc::

  let g:chapa_messages = 0
