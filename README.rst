Chapa
=====
A very simple VIM plugin to visually select a Function or a Class

Simple approach to visual selection of Python blocks.

Installation couldn't be easier: drop the plugin file in your vim plugin 
directory.

I would highly recommend you use something like Pathogen though, it 
makes dealing with VIM plugins way easier.

1. Intro                                 
==============================================================================

After trying other plugins that were supposed to achieve this objective (and 
fail) I decided to write it on my own. 

The initial approach is to be able to simply have a visual selection of a 
Python Class or Function.

No need to have VIM compiled with Python support since this plugin uses 
pure VIM syntax.

2. Usage                                
==============================================================================

Straightforward (for now). Chapa has 2 public calls that you can map to 
anything you want. If you had a leader mapping, it woul look similar to 
this:

nmap <Leader>c <Esc>:ChapaVisualClass <CR>
nmap <Leader>f <Esc>:ChapaVisualFunction <CR>

When either is called, it goes to the start of the selection and starts a 
visual block until indentation no longer applies.

If the requested search (function or class) is not found, the call simply 
returns and nothing should happen.

3. License
