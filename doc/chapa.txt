1. Intro                                                          *ChapaIntro*

After trying other plugins that were supposed to achieve this objective (and 
fail) I decided to write it on my own. 

The initial approach was to be able to have a visual selection of a 
Python Class or Function.

Since then I have added a couple more callables to be able to move around 
functions, methods and classes forwards or backwards.

No need to have VIM compiled with Python support since this plugin uses 
pure VIM syntax.

2. Usage                                                          *ChapaUsage*

Straightforward (for now). Chapa has 8 public calls that you can map to 
anything you want. 

You can map those callables to anything you want, but below is how the 
author maps them (better mnemonics):

" Function Movement
nmap fpf <Plug>ChapaNextFunction
nmap Fpf <Plug>ChapaPreviousFunction

" Class Movement
nmap fpc <Plug>ChapaNextClass
nmap Fpc <Plug>ChapaPreviousClass

" Method Movement
nmap fpm <Plug>ChapaNextMethod
nmap Fpm <Plug>ChapaPreviousMethod

" Method Visual Select 
nmap vac <Plug>ChapaVisualNextClass
nmap vic <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousClass 
nmap vaC <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousClass

" Class Visual Select
nmap vaf <Plug>ChapaVisualNextFunction
nmap vif <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousFunction
nmap vaF <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousFunction

" Method Visual Select
nmap vam <Plug>ChapaVisualNextMethod
nmap vim <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousMethod
nmap vaM <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousMethod

If you catched it, some of them are repeated: when inside a class, method or 
function you would want to search the previous match, so ``vic`` that means 
"visually select inside class" you actually want the previous instance of 
the class that is (most of the time) correct if you are within a class.

If the requested search (function, class or method) is not found, the call simply 
returns and nothing should happen. However, there is an error message that should 
display by default, explaining what it was supposed to search and in what 
direction.

You can disable this by adding a chapa-specific variable in your vimrc: 

let g:chapa_messages = 0

You can also add a "count" to repeat the match N times. So if you want to go 
to 3 previous classes you would (with the mappings above) do something like:

3Fpc

A lot of the code for this plugin was adapted/copied from python.vim 
and python_fn.vim authored by Jon Franklin and Mikael Berthe.
